## Install

```sh
$ npm install delete-react-zombies
```

## Usage

```sh
$ delete-react-zombies
```

**Options**:

- `--path` define the path where search zombies (default=process.cwd)
- `--verbose` show in the console the file content to be deleted
- `--force` don't ask confirm before delete files.

## How it works

The package search in your files the keyword `import ${componentName}`.
The `componentName` variable is the name of the component that is exported.
To understand the component name I'm using [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen)
