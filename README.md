## Install

```sh
$ npm install delete-react-zombies
```

## Usage

```sh
$ delete-react-zombies
```

**Options**:

-   `--path` define the path where search zombies (default=process.cwd)
-   `--verbose` show in the console the file content to be deleted
-   `--force` don't ask confirm before delete files.
-   `--ignoreNodeModules` skip looking in the node_modules folder
-   `--absoluteImports` include the baseUrl in the path

## How it works

The package create a list of components in your application.
Based on that, the library search in your files content the keyword `import ${componentName}`, where the `componentName` variable is the name of the component that is exported.

## Absolute imports (baseUrl)

If your react project is configured to support [importing modules & components using absolute paths](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/importing-a-component/#absolute-imports) then turning this on will add the base url into the path & component name check.
